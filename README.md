# Type Challenges Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and solutions while working through the **TypeScript Type Challenges**.

The goal is to improve my understanding of:
- TypeScript’s type system
- Advanced types
- Type-level programming concepts

This is purely for learning and experimentation.
